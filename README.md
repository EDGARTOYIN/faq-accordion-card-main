## My process

I thought this was going to revolve more around the accordion functionality, but I realized that these challenge were more focused on how to manage the images and their sizes widthout breaking the desing with the screen sizes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind-css

### What I learned

I learned how to manage an accordion style effectively, but I encountered significant challenges with absolute elements. In my design, opening one accordion item expands the parent, and I acknowledge that I still have much to improve in that area.

### Continued development

I need to delve much deeper into learning how to position absolute elements.
